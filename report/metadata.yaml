# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "This paper presents a reproducibility study of the work 
          'Optimizing Deep Learning Inference on Embedded Systems Through Adaptive Model Selection.' 
          The original study proposes methods for improving deep learning inference on power-constrained 
          systems using a premodel selection pipeline. Our replication focuses on reproducing their results 
          in image classification and machine translation. We implemented most of the code from scratch 
          and attempted to replicate the key findings. While we achieved similar results in some areas, 
          our overall findings differ due to missing methodological details in the original article."
